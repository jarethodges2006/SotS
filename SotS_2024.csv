The Special Considerations for Gifted Identification Checklist (Appendix B) makes provisions for certain factors that exist that may require special considerations when inappropriate instruments are used during the assessment process. All students should be considered when using the Special Considerations for Gifted Identification Checklist. These students shall be given special consideration(s) during the gifted
identification process.
IDENTIFICATION PROCESS 1: MASS SCREENING
Stage 1: Mass Screening
This process requires all Mississippi districts to screen all students in at least one grade level each year. Districts shall use a normed group measure of intelligence in the Mass Screening Referral Process. This process assists in identifying students in underrepresented populations. Students who obtain a full-scale score at or above the 90th percentile on the normed group measure of intelligence shall move forward
in the referral process. Any student who does not meet the minimum acceptable criteria (score in the 90th percentile) on the normed group measure of intelligence during the Mass Screening
Referral Process and does not qualify for the Special Considerations for Gifted identification criteria, can be referred by anyone for the Individual Referral for Screening Process. The individually referred student shall not be excluded from the referral process by performance on the normed group measure of intelligence administered during the Mass Screening Referral Process. Students with special considerations for gifted assessment, who scored at or above the 84th percentile but lower than the 90th percentile on the normed group measure shall move forward in the gifted identification process.

Stage 2: Data Collection
The next step in the process will consist of the collection of substantiated
student data obtained through the use of other objective and subjective measures.
District personnel shall make decisions as to which measures will be used during this step of the Mass Screening Referral Process. A student shall satisfy TWO of the
following referral criteria (with a total of THREE) before moving forward to the LSC Review of Referral Data Stage:
 A score at or above the superior range on a normed, published
characteristics of giftedness checklist
 A score at or above the superior range on a normed, published
measure of creativity
 A score at or above the superior range on a normed, published
measure of leadership
 A score at or above the 90th percentile on total language, total
math, total reading, total science, total social studies, or the
composite on a normed achievement test
 A score at or above the 90th percentile on a normed measure
of cognitive ability
 A score at or above the 90th percentile on an existing measure
of individual intelligence that has been administered within the
past twelve months
 Other measures that are documented in the research on the
identification of intellectually gifted students
Students with special considerations for gifted assessment who
scored at or above the 84th percentile but lower than the 90th
percentile on the preceding criteria shall move forward in the
gifted identification process.",https://www.mdek12.org/sites/default/files/documents/OAE/OEER/Intervention%20Services/2023_gep_regs_approved_12_21_23.pdf,"Used for Referral for Identification,Used for Identification",,,Yes,"The process requires all Mississippi districts to screen all students in the 1st grade, usually in the spring semester.","Yes, LEAs can choose from a list of approved instruments/assessments",A normed group measure of intelligence,,"25,151","25,151",,"457,954",We do not monitor or collect data from private schools.,"25,151",,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,Yes,,Yes,,Yes,,,,"Number of identified gifted students,Availability of Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate/Cambridge courses,Dual or concurrent enrollment with institutions of higher education",,,Both Monitor and Audit,,"Yes, program implementation plans must be submitted.",,"Yes, identification plans must be approved.,Yes, program implementation plans must be approved.,Yes, policy plans must be approved.",,Yes,https://www.mdek12.org/sites/default/files/documents/OAE/OEER/Intervention%20Services/2023_gep_regs_approved_12_21_23.pdf,Yes,"Each local district superintendent shall appoint at least two Gifted Education Contact Persons (GEP) Contacts.

Districts began reporting these data to TEA in 2011-12. The data are submitted on the 43415 Course Completion Subcategory during the summer submission of the Public Education Information Management System (PEIMS), a statewide data system for public education information in Texas. School districts submit their data, which are defined in a yearly publication, the TSDS TEDS Data Standards.

These reports include students enrolled in public school districts and charter schools. The reports do not include students in private schools.

Reported Information
The report shows, by district, by region, or for the entire state, each of the courses offered where students earn college credit hours. It provides counts of students earning college credit, the total number of college credit hours earned, and the average hours per student. The same counts and percentages are shown for career and technical education (CTE) students, as well. From 2020-2021 to 2021-2022, the counts and percentages are shown for CTE Explorers, Concentrators and Completers only. Beginning with 2022-2023, the following students are identified as CTE students:

CTE Program Participant: A student completing either only one CTE course for any number of credits or more than one course for less than two credits where a CTE course is defined by 19 TAC Chapter 126 (C), 127 (B) or 130 (the student does not have to pass or receive credit).
CTE Program Explorer: A student completing two or more high school CTE courses for a total of two or more credits defined by 19 TAC Chapter 126 (C), 127 (B) or 130 and not a participant, concentrator or completer (the student does not have to pass or receive credit).
CTE Program Concentrator: A student completing and passing two or more 19 TAC Chapter 126 (C), 127 (B) or 130 CTE courses for a total of at least two credits within the same program of study and not a completer.
CTE Program Completer: A student completing and passing three or more 19 TAC Chapter 126 (C), 127 (B) or 130 CTE courses for a total of four or more credits within a program of study, including one level three or level four course from within the same program of study.
When a student earns college credit hours in multiple courses, the student is counted multiple times in the ""Total"" row.

The program plan shall describe the assessment process used by the AU for identifying students who meet the definition specified in section 12.01(16) and for identifying the educational needs of gifted students. The assessment process shall recognize a student’s exceptional abilities or potential, interests, and needs in order to guide student instruction and individualized planning and programming. In traditionally underrepresented student groups and visual/music/performing arts student groups or talent pools, identification may require the collection of student information over time, using additional data points from a response to intervention approach, or additional assessment. The AU identification procedures shall include, but need not be limited to:

12.02(2)(c)(i) A method(s) to ensure equal and equitable access for all students. The program plan shall describe the efforts that the AU will make to identify gifted students from all populations, including preschool (if applicable) through twelfth grade students, minority students, economically diverse students, culturally diverse students, students with limited English proficiency and children with disabilities;

12.02(2)(c)(ii) Referral procedures that seek referrals from a variety of sources, and screening procedures used for conducting identification assessment. Every AU is strongly encouraged to include optional universal screening in identification procedures;

12.02(2)(c)(iii) A time line of no more than 30 school days after a referral to determine whether a student will continue with formal identification assessment, or will receive talent pool designation;

12.02(2)(c)(iv) Implementation of assessments that align with the purpose of identifying exceptionality in the categories of giftedness, and in traditionally underrepresented populations. The AU may choose local assessment tools from the Department’s chart of common and varied assessment tools used in identification;

12.02(2)(c)(v) Collection of data for a body of evidence that includes, but is not limited to: assessment results from multiple sources and multiple types of data (i.e. qualitative and quantitative data about achievement, cognitive ability, performance, parent and teacher input, motivation and observations of gifted characteristics/behaviors). The body of evidence contains data to identify the strength area defined in the definition of gifted children and determine appropriate programming services. These same categories are used in data collection and for developing the ALP;

12.02(2)(c)(vi) A review team procedure; and that includes at least one person trained or endorsed in gifted identification and programming;

12.02(2)(c)(vii) A review team procedure for determining identification or a talent pool designation from a body of evidence and for developing individualized ALPs for identified students. When only cognitive ability assessment data meets criteria in a body of evidence, the review team may determine that the student is identified with general or specific intellectual ability. This identification meets the condition of portability.

12.02(2)(c)(viii) A determination letter for parents and school files describing the decision of the review team, and area(s) of giftedness if the student is found to have exceptional abilities; and

12.02(2)(c)(ix) A communication procedure by which parents are made aware of the identification assessment process for their student, understand the results of the determination, and engage in the development and review of the student’s ALP.

 
Criteria for Determining Exceptional Ability (Giftedness) or Talent Pool 12.02(2)(d)
12.02(2)(d)(i) For each category of giftedness defined in 12.01(16), criteria for exceptional ability means: 95 percentile or above on a standardized nationally normed test or observation tool, or a rating on a performance assessment that indicates exceptionality/distinguished compared to age mates.

12.02(2)(d)(ii) Not meeting criteria on a single assessment tool shall not prevent further data collection or consideration for identification, if other indicators suggest exceptional potential as observed in a body of evidence.

22-20-201. Legislative declaration.
(1) The general assembly, recognizing the obligation of the state of Colorado to provide educational opportunities to all children that will enable them to lead fulfilling and productive lives, declares that the purpose of this part 2 is to provide means for identifying and educating those children who are gifted.
(2) It is the intent of the general assembly that:
(a) Evidence-based practices support instruction and the social and emotional development of gifted children; and
(b) Each gifted child is educated in a rigorous learning environment and culture that develops the child’s areas of exceptionality and coordinates programs and services among available support systems.
(3) The general assembly further finds and declares that traditional assessment methods may not adequately identify some gifted children, including children from all socioeconomic, ethnic, and cultural populations and gifted children who also have disabilities. It is therefore the general assembly’s intent that the state board, the department, and every administrative unit include all student groups in each administrative unit’s procedures for identifying gifted children and for developing educational programs that include gifted children.
(4) The general assembly declares that, for purposes of section 17 of article IX of the state constitution, gifted education programs are accountable programs to meet state academic standards and may therefore receive funding from the state education fund created in section 17 (4) of article IX of the state constitution.

(a) Each school district shall adopt and use a system to locate and identify all students within that district who are thought to be gifted and in need of specially designed instruction.

(b) Each school district shall conduct awareness activities to inform the public of gifted education services and programs and the manner by which to request these services and programs. These awareness activities shall be designed to reach parents of students enrolled in the public schools and the parents of school age children not enrolled in the public schools. Awareness activities shall be conducted annually and include providing information in local newspapers, other media, student handbooks and on the school district web site.

(c) Each school district shall determine the student’s needs through a screening and evaluation process which meets the requirements of this chapter.

(d) Each school district shall establish procedures to determine whether a student is mentally gifted. This term includes a person who has an IQ of 130 or higher or when multiple criteria as set forth in this chapter and in Department Guidelines indicate gifted ability. Determination of gifted ability will not be based on IQ score alone. Deficits in memory or processing speed, as indicated by testing, cannot be the sole basis upon which a student is determined to be ineligible for gifted special education. A person with an IQ score lower than 130 may be admitted to gifted programs when other educational criteria in the profile of the person strongly indicate gifted ability. Determination of mentally gifted must include an assessment by a certified school psychologist.

(e) Multiple criteria indicating gifted ability include:

(1) A year or more above grade achievement level for the normal age group in one or more subjects as measured by Nationally normed and validated achievement tests able to accurately reflect gifted performance. Subject results shall yield academic instruction levels in all academic subject areas.

(2) An observed or measured rate of acquisition/retention of new academic content or skills that reflect gifted ability.

(3) Demonstrated achievement, performance or expertise in one or more academic areas as evidenced by excellence of products, portfolio or research, as well as criterion-referenced team judgment.

(4) Early and measured use of high level thinking skills, academic creativity, leadership skills, intense academic interest areas, communications skills, foreign language aptitude or technology expertise.

",No,,"ESSA did not impact the state of North Carolina in the same way it did other states because our state already included gifted students as a subgroup in our statewide accountability model and there were already partnerships in place across districts to use federal dollars to support professional development focused on the characteristics and needs of gifted learners. In addition, our NC AIG Program Standards included some discussion of program accountability, which included the review of student achievement and growth, for both individual gifted students and the subgroup of gifted learners in a district or charter school. One major area where NC benefited with the reauthorization of ESEA, was the opportunity for our
state to be able to eliminate double testing for middle school students specifically, who were accelerated into the introductory high school math course (NC Math 1) while still in eighth grade. Our state did codify the reporting in our state plan to acknowledge its value to the State. To better address the question regarding an annual gifted report, NC plans to put this in policy for the 2025-2026 school year.

",No,,"ESSA did not impact the state of North Carolina in the same way it did other states because our state already included gifted students as a subgroup in our statewide accountability model and there were already partnerships in place across districts to use federal dollars to support professional development focused on the characteristics and needs of gifted learners. In addition, our NC AIG Program Standards included some discussion of program accountability, which included the review of student achievement and growth, for both individual gifted students and the subgroup of gifted learners in a district or charter school. One major area where NC benefited with the reauthorization of ESEA, was the opportunity for our
state to be able to eliminate double testing for middle school students specifically, who were accelerated into the introductory high school math course (NC Math 1) while still in eighth grade. Our state did codify the reporting in our state plan to acknowledge its value to the State. To better address the question regarding an annual gifted report, NC plans to put this in policy for the 2025-2026 school year.
